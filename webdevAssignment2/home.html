    <h1>THE WTC FINAL</h1>
    <p>
        The countdown to the inaugural ICC World Test Championship final has begun,
        with the Indian cricket team gearing up to board the flight to the United Kingdom.
       The historic clash between India and New Zealand at Southampton has already become a 
       talking point all across the globe but there are certain issues with the format that the International Cricket Council
       <span>is yet to find an answer to.</span>
       <br>
       Some formidaable players from the New Zealand side will be Ross Taylor, the skipper Kane Williamson and their worthy opener
       Tom Latham. The fast bowlers make onee of the best pace bowling trio in the world. One problem India would be facing is who 
       will open with the Hitman Rohit Sharma. Will it be Mayank Agarwal or they would go on with Shubman Gill.

        There is a reserve day if rain plays the spoilsport.
